## Overview
HoloLensARToolKit is a successful experiment to integrate [ARToolKit](http://artoolkit.org/) with [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us), or generally UWP (Universal Windows Platform). With fiducial marker tracking provided by ARToolKit, plus the indoor localization of HoloLens, many Augmented Reality applications would be made possible.

This repository contains:
- Wrapper of ARToolKit5 for UWP
- Unity package to interface the native library
- A sample Unity application to demo the use of them
- Camera calibration of HoloLens
